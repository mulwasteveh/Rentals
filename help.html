		<h1>Hello Bungoma People, you have saved up some money to rent a room and you are ready to make a move. It is a huge step that requires preparations.</h1><br>

<p>It is important to be guided on how to make the right choice that will make your effort worthwhile.</p><br>

In this part, you will be reading 10 best tips for successfully renting a house. They highlight what you must do to ensure that you choose the best house that fits your lifestyle.<br>

<h1>These tips are divided into 4 broad categories:</h1>

Financial<br>
Physical assessment<br>
Social interaction<br>
Legal<br>
<h3>Each one is essential and will help you to make the right choice.</h3>

<h4>Financial Tips</h4>
<p>These are related to your finances and how you plan to handle the financial aspect of renting the house. It is better to be prepared beforehand as to the financial responsibilities than to be caught unawares.</p><br>

<p> 1. Discover the prices of other houses within the location
Tips for renting a house.</p>

<h4>There is a price range for every size.</h4>

<p>Find out the cost of renting houses around the location. This might also include comparing prices while considering the physical features of each house.</p><br>

Factoring in the structure, size, and facilities of each house would also make your price comparison useful.<br>

Discovering the price helps you to know if the price offered to you is worth it or outrageous.<br>

<h4>2. Understand the cost of housing</h4>
You already have a budget but the extra expenses of renting a house might surprise you.  The rent itself is one thing and the extra expenses are another thing.  <br>

<h4>3. Agree on a payment plan</h4>
Rent payments come in different packages.<br>

You must know the style the landlord or agent adopts to get rent payment. It might be made on a monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually. It might also involve advance payment. Having foreknowledge will also help you to determine if it suits you or not.<br>

Remember that you’re the one renting the house, so only what is convenient for you should be agreed on. Any payment plan that would be a burden to your finances should be avoided. Or a better plan can be made and agreed on. Also, understand how the rent increase would be if any.<br>

Agree to what will benefit you and not weigh you down in the long-run.<br>

<h2>Physical Assessment Tips</h2>
You can’t be sure about the physical condition of the house by description or word-of-mouth. You have to do proper assessments and check out for certain things before you pay.<br>

<h4>4. Inspect the house for any damage</h4>
Repair for damages you didn’t cause might be on you.<br>

Some damages might have been done in the house before you move in, especially if you’re not the first person to live there. A new house may also have defects while building. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect it even if it is new.<br>

Check for cracks on walls and floors, leaks from taps or pipes, broken doors or windows, and everything in the house. This is vital so that you can inform the landlord or agent for repairs before you move in. You don’t want to be responsible for what you didn’t cause.<br>

Any defect that can cause harm should be repaired before you move in.

<h4>5. Make evidence of the physical state</h4>
There’s nothing as good as indisputable evidence.<br>

While you’ve informed the landlord or agent about defects in the house, you should also have evidence with you.<br>

In some cases, the damage to the home might be something you can manage until a repair is made. So, moving in won’t be a problem.
<br>
The information given to the landlord or agent about the damage should also be recorded. It could be as a video or pictures to serve as proof that the damage or defect was present before you moved in. It might also be proper to have a written document signed by both of you as evidence.<br>

There is no ruling out the place of evidence in anything, even housing.<br>
